# .emacs.d contents

My personal configuration of Emacs 24.x for Clojure development.

To install Emacs 24 on Debian based distros:
1. Add PPA https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs
1. Execute `sudo apt-get install emacs24 emacs24-el emacs24-common-non-dfsg`.

To use this configuration:
1. In case you have an existing configuration you don't want to loose make a backup of your `~/.emacs` and `~/.emacs.d`.
1. Remove `~/.emacs.d`. 
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/friemen/emacsd.git ~/.emacs.d`.
1. Start Emacs, get something to drink.
1. Restart Emacs.
